# Just Average

Given a list of integers nums and an integer k, return true if you can remove exactly one element from the list to make the average equal to exactly k.

Constraints
```
2 ≤ n ≤ 1,000 where n is length of nums
nums[i], k ≤ 1,000,000
```
### Example 1

Input
```
nums = [1, 2, 3, 10]
k = 2
```
Output
```
True
```

Explanation

We can take 10 out to reach an average of 2 since (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2

### Example 2

Input
```
nums = [1, 3]
k = 2
```

Output
```
False
```

Explanation

If we remove 1, we get an average of 3 and if we remove 3, we get an average of 1.
